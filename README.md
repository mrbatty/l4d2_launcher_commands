# l4d2_launcher_commands
Launcher Commands I use for Left 4 Dead 2, for a mix between better performance and better image quality than the original.

After many years of playing and loving this game, I have found a way to bypass the limit of launcher cvars one can use.
No more messing around in launcher options through Steam only to have those deleted when it decides it's time to update.

  Pretty much all of these cvar changes will be displayed in versus.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Install script.cfg and script2.cfg into left4dead2/cfg folder

Use my .bat to start the game.

  You will need Rinput installed in C:\ , or edit my .bat and play using subpar mouse processing. (in-game raw mouse input is garbage)
If mouse doesn't register,  disable RAWINPUT in game settings.
Applying with video settings might reset the fov and you'll need to type in console from main menu "exec script.cfg", or restart the game from my bat.

....

Many of these settings I still don't know what they do and can only figure it out through my knowledge of game design, intuition, trial and error.
I have left some at default in the script because they might have been game breaking and could give you a hard time if you decide to experiment with them. each command comes with a description of what it does (or i believe it to do).

Have fun, it is a great game which lives on after many many years.
