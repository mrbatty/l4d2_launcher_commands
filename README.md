# l4d2_launcher_commands
Launcher Commands I use for Left 4 Dead 2, for a mix between better performance and better image quality (IQ) than the original.

Basically turning an old, flawed and ugly -but great- game, into a glorious version it should have been from the start, and actually playable!

....

After many years of playing and loving this game, I have found a way to bypass the limit of launcher cvars one can use.
Also, no more messing around in launcher options through Steam only to have those deleted when it decides it's time to update.

I have spent WAY TOO MANY HOURS experimenting with launcher cvars, enjoy.

  Pretty much all of these cvar changes will be displayed in versus.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install script.cfg and script2.cfg into left4dead2/cfg folder
2. Add this line to your autoexec.cfg: 

alias fov "exec script2"

3. Use my .bat to start the game. Edit it to suit your needs.

That's it!

You will need Rinput https://fearless-assassins.com/files/file/1656-rinput/ installed in C:\ , or edit my .bat and play using subpar mouse processing. (in-game raw mouse input is garbage)

If mouse doesn't register,  disable RAWINPUT in game settings.

WARNING. Editing and Applying video settings might reset the fov and you'll need to type in console from main menu "exec script.cfg", or restart the game from my bat.

WARNING. DO NOT run .bat without having started Steam, as Rinput might not register the game widow.

DISCLAIMERS:

1. These are my preferences, I am not willing to create a high fps config, where everything looks like cardboard and you get an insane advantage through a mediocre gaming experience. I am a different kind of sicko, who likes to actually look at pretty visuals in his spare time.

If you want to make your own config, you can look up Valve's cvars in order to familiarize yourself with the environment and experiment yourself: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/List_of_L4D2_Cvars

2. Many of these settings I still don't know what they do and can only figure it out through my knowledge of game design, intuition, trial and error. I have changed many settings for a placebo effect, or in hopes it might increase IQ or better performance in some miniscule way.

I also have left some cvars at default in the script because they might have been game breaking and could give you a hard time if you decide to experiment with them. each command comes with a description of what it does (or i believe it to do). USE AT OWN RISK.

3. My setup is inevitably different from yours. I use an Alienware ultrawide monitor at 43:18 aspect ratio, which I've calculated my FOV settings for, using this online calculator: https://casualhacks.net/Source-FOV-calculator.html

My main FOV is tuned for 140 degrees of view (approximately human field of view) , which in other aspect ratios my values might be too much.

;;;;

HAVE FUN, it is a great game which lives on after many, many years, with a thriving highly toxic, highly skilled community.
