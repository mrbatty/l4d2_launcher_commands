# l4d2_launcher_commands
Launcher Commands I use for Left 4 Dead 2, for a mix between better performance and better image quality than the original.

After many years of playing and loving this game, I have found a way to bypass the limit of launcher cvars one can use.
No more messing around in launcher options through Steam only to have those deleted when it decides it's time to update.

  Pretty much all of these cvars will be displayed in versus.

INSTRUCTIONS
Install script.cfg and script2.cfg into left4dead2/cfg folder

Use my .bat to start the game.

  You will need Rinput, or edit my cfg and play using subpar mouse processing. (in-game raw mouse input is garbage)
If mouse doesn't register,  disable RAWINPUT in game settings.
Messing with video settings will reset the fov and you'll need to type in console from main menu "exec script.cfg", or restart the game from my bat.
